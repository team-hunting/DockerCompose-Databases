## Docker Compose guides for orchestrating with a DB

These projects involve using docker-compose to spin up database containers, and other containers that interact with them. NocoDB and Baserow are 'spreadsheet style' front ends (Open source Airtable clones) with which you can interact with your database.

Other projects here spin up a flask API in one container which can interact with the database in the other container.
